                            p   I worked on this project for the Lawrence Livermore National Lab from January 2015, until the middle of August. This was my first real web project, so now when I go back and look at it I spend the first couple minutes just cringing at my crappy javascript. I loved working on this, and my mentor at LLNL couldn't have done a better job of setting me up to really enjoy it. They gave me a huge project, using a ton of technology I'd never heard of before, and just left me the hell alone to run with it.
